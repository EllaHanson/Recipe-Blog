Proposal:  
  Our idea is to create a backend api for a recipe blog that will  
  allow user to log what they cook. Users can keep through their own  
  diary of recipies as well as look through others posted recipes.   
  There would then be a system to leave ratings and comments on any   
  recipe they make. Searching through recipes would include being  
  able to filter through the recipes by ingredient, time needed, etc.
